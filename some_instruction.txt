After creating backend.. back in react files, run "npm i react-router-dom concurrently"
even without concurrently both frontend and backend can be run on different server, but concurrently provides more convenience.
after that, go to package.json of front-end and add a script in the scripts -> 
"runboth": "concurrently \"npm run start\" \"nodemon backend/index.js\""
^as done in line 21 of this folder's package.json
after that you can type command -> "npm run runboth" to execute both frontend and backend in the same terminal 

Don't forget to use `npm i cors` if facing cors policy issues
